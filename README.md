### 🎫 Ticketing System Practice (osTicket)

- Deployed **osTicket on Ubuntu (UTM)**
- Logged, triaged, escalated, and resolved **30+ realistic support tickets**
- Practiced:
  - SLA awareness
  - Escalation documentation
  - End-user communication
- Linked tickets to:
  - Active Directory user management
  - Cloud identity issues
  - DNS and network troubleshooting
