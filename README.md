# 🚀 Featured Projects

## 🧪 IT Support & Security Home Lab (Hybrid AD + Cloud Identity) (In Progress)
**Technologies:** Active Directory · Windows Server · Ubuntu · UTM · osTicket  

Designed and built a hybrid enterprise-style lab to simulate real IT support and identity management environments.

**Key Highlights:**
- Deployed Windows Server as a Domain Controller
- Configured AD DS, Users, Groups, OUs, and GPOs
- Implemented RBAC and least privilege principles
- Practiced MFA troubleshooting and identity workflows
- Logged & resolved realistic support tickets
- Simulated DNS failures, login issues, and endpoint alerts

This lab mirrors real-world help desk and junior sysadmin responsibilities.
