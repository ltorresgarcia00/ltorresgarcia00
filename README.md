## 🧪 Projects (In Progress)

### 🧠 IT Support & Security Home Lab (Modern / Hybrid)
**Help Desk · Cloud Identity · Endpoint Management · Ticketing**

- Built a **hybrid IT support lab** using **UTM on macOS** with **Windows 11 ARM** and **Ubuntu Linux**
- Configured **Windows 11 as a cloud-joined device** using **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**
- Created and managed **users, groups, roles, and access policies**
- Practiced **account recovery, access troubleshooting, and endpoint security**
- Simulated **Tier 1 / Tier 2 IT support scenarios** in a modern cloud-first environment

---

### 🎫 Ticketing System Practice (osTicket)
- Deployed **osTicket on Ubuntu (UTM)** to simulate a real help desk environment
- Logged, triaged, escalated, and resolved **30+ realistic support tickets**
- Practiced **technical documentation, escalation notes, and end-user communication**
- Linked tickets to **Windows 11 endpoint issues, identity access problems, and security events**

**Example issues handled**
- Login failures, password resets, and account recovery
- MFA and access issues (cloud identity scenarios)
- Network connectivity and DNS troubleshooting
- Slow system performance and application errors
- Security-related alerts and investigations
